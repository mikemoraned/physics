Overall Idea/Goal:

- simulation of water flowing over real terrain, projected onto a map

TODOs:

- (/) simple web-app
  - supports es6 modules
  - shows a random ball moving in a canvas
  - a clear update/draw separation
- (/) move update logic into rust
- (/) add very simple rapier 2d sim loop,
  - runs for some number of iterations as part of update loop
  - simulates no items
  - shows nothing
- (x) simple sim of ball falling due to gravity, with 2d position of ball showing
- ...
